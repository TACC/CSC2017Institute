Learn the basic skills necessary to develop and execute life sciences workflows on large-scale systems, run parallel analyses, use Bash and Python to chain common life sciences applications together to form more complex workflows, and analyze result data in order to gain useful insights. Spend time one-on-one with TACC's Life Sciences Computing group discussing how to accelerate your existing research or how to start a new project by beginning with the best computational practices.

Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. Laptops will require a terminal application for accessing compute resources.
