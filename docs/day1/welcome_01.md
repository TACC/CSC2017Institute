# Welcome to Computational Science in the Cloud

### Getting Set Up

Please log in to the WiFi (see handout), and make sure you have the following required software for your operating system:

Mac / Linux:

```
  'Terminal' application
  Chrome/Firefox web browser
```

Windows:

```
  'PuTTY' application

You will also need a TACC account and to be added to our Training allocation on JetStream for launching Virtual Machines. 


### Objectives for the Computational Science in the Cloud Summer Institute

 Provide attendees the basic skills needed to:
 1. Use cloud infrastructure-as-a-service for launching virtual servers
 2. Automate cloud deployments using devops tools such as Ansible
 3. Build a progressively more complex reproducible computational environment using progressively more automation
 4. Write Python scripts within Jupyter notebooks for performing reproducible data analysis
 5. Utilize cloud APIs such as Agave for accessing and storing results
